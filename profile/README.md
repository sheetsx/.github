## Coming Soon!

SheeTSX is in pre-alpha development. Stay tuned for updates.

## What is SheeTSX?

SheeTSX is a framework aimed at revolutionizing the creation and maintenance of complex Google Sheets. It focuses on bringing developer-friendly workflows to spreadsheet management.

### Why SheeTSX?

Many organizations rely heavily on intricate Google Sheets that contain crucial business logic. These sheets often become:

- A single point of failure, with only one person knowing how to modify them safely.
- A source of anxiety, requiring multiple backups to prevent loss of critical information.
- Too complex to replace with custom applications, despite their limitations.

SheeTSX aims to bridge the gap between the flexibility of spreadsheets and the robustness of modern software development practices.

## Goals

1. Enhance spreadsheet development with tools familiar to software developers.
2. Improve collaboration and reduce risks associated with complex sheet modifications.
3. Provide organizations with a sustainable way to maintain and evolve their critical spreadsheets.

Stay tuned for more updates as we develop this innovative approach to spreadsheet management!
